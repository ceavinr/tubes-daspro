## PreReq
- Python 3.8+

## rich requirements
- Rich works with OSX, Linux and Windows.
- On Windows both the (ancient) cmd.exe terminal is supported and the new Windows Terminal. The latter has much improved support for color and style.
- Rich requires Python 3.6.3 and above. Note that Python 3.6.0 is not supported due to lack of support for methods on NamedTuples.
